This repository contains python files:
- a modified version of HyperDrive (see https://github.com/guyhoulsby/HyperDrive), the hyperplasticity engine created by Guy Houlsby.
- a model file for HySand_base (that can be used with one or multiple surfaces).
- a model file for a single-surface model with density and anisotropy dependent dilation as described in the theoretical article.
- a data file to run all illustrative tests of the theoretical article, as well as all air-pluviated on Karlsruhe fine sand available from Wichtmann's website (https://www.torsten-wichtmann.de/).
- a test command file containing triaxial test routine adapted for the use of HySand.
