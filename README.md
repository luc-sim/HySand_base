# HySand_base
HySand repository with all files for 2025 theory and performance articles

This repository contains python files:
- a modified version of HyperDrive (see https://github.com/guyhoulsby/HyperDrive), the hyperplasticity engine created by Prof. Guy Houlsby.
- a model file for HySand_base (that can be used with one or multiple surfaces).
- a model file for a single-surface model with density and anisotropy dependent dilation as described in the theoretical article.
- two data files: one to run all illustrative tests of the theoretical article; another to run all air-pluviated tests on Karlsruhe fine sand available from Prof. Torsten Wichtmann's website (https://www.torsten-wichtmann.de/) for the appraisal article.
- a test command file containing triaxial test routine adapted for the use of HySand.
- a plotting file containing plotting routines (newplot.py).
- a file to download in the HyperDrive working format Wichtmann's data.
